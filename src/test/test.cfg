## Copy of the config for "sim6502" target, with ONE change.
## If this becomes obsolete, replace it with a fresh copy,
## and re-adjust ZP so the compiler avoids using the first
## half of it (or otherwise keeps out the way of monitor,
## and traditionally "free" spots (those might get used
## by Taki).
