## Customized config for "sim6502" target.
##
## Moves compiler's zero-page globals past $80, so they don't
## tread on important Apple 2 Monitor globals.
##
## Moves MAIN allocation area to start past Apple 2 low-res text
## pages ($400-7FF and $800-$BFF), and the Taki routines we're
## testing (~$D00 - ??).
##
## Adds a segment for faked-out Apple 2 console I/O firmware routines,
## and uses fill values in memory sections to ensure everything
## is stored contiguously (sim65 just loads the entire file, after
## the header, into memory, offset only by MAIN's start position.
## Note that it also uses MAIN's end position to determine where
## the C language stack is located.)
