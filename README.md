# TAKI - Text Animation KIt (for the Apple \]\[)

[Try it out in an in-browser Apple II emulator!](http://micah.cowan.name/apple2js/apple2jse.html#taki) The ADVENTURE.DEMO program is particularly recommended.

**Taki** aims to provide a facility for various animated text effects
on the screen of your Apple \]\[.

Design goals include:
  * Text effects must run as smoothly as possible
  * It must be possible to use in machine-language code without
    AppleSoft loaded (language card in use for something else?)
  * It must be possible to use text effects, easily, from legible AppleSoft BASIC code.
