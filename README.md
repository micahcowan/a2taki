**Taki** aims to provide a facility for various animated text effects
on the screen of your Apple \]\[.

Design goals include:
  * Text effects must run as smoothly as possible
  * It must be possible to use in machine-language code without
    AppleSoft loaded (language card in use for something else?)
  * It must be possible to use text effects, easily, from legible AppleSoft BASIC code.
